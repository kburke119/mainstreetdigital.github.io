# GitHub Push Instructions

## The Issue
The Git repository has a lock file that prevents direct pushing from Replit. Here's how to resolve this:

## Option 1: Direct GitHub Upload (Recommended)

### Step 1: Download Files Individually
Since the zip download isn't working, download these files one by one from the Replit file explorer:

**Main Files:**
- `index.html`
- `our-apps.html`
- `CNAME`
- `robots.txt`
- `sitemap.xml`

**CSS Files:**
- `assets/css/main.css`
- `assets/css/style.css`

**JavaScript:**
- `assets/js/main.js`

**Images:**
- `assets/images/main-street-logo.png`
- `assets/images/Digital Marketing Audit Example.gif`
- `assets/images/f-shape-1.svg`
- `assets/images/portfolio-placeholder.svg`
- `assets/images/slider/1.svg`
- `assets/images/slider/2.svg`
- `assets/images/slider/3.svg`

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/kburke119/mainstreetdigital.github.io
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop your files maintaining the folder structure
4. Commit with message: "Enhanced website design and added Our Apps page"

## Option 2: GitHub Desktop (If you have it)
1. Clone your repository locally
2. Copy the files from Replit to your local folder
3. Commit and push using GitHub Desktop

## Option 3: Command Line (If you're comfortable)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kburke119/mainstreetdigital.github.io.git
# Copy files to the cloned directory
git add .
git commit -m "Enhanced website design and added Our Apps page"
git push origin main
```

## What You're Uploading
✓ Professional redesigned homepage
✓ New "Our Apps" page with pricing structure
✓ Real Digital Marketing Audit GIF
✓ Mobile-responsive design
✓ Clean navigation and footer
✓ Enhanced hero section with slider

Your site will be live at GitHub Pages automatically after upload!
