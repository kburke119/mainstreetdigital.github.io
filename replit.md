## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Build System**: SASS for CSS preprocessing with live-server for development
- **Architecture Pattern**: Static site with component-based styling approach
- **Performance Strategy**: CDN-based external libraries with local asset optimization

### Styling System
- **CSS Architecture**: Modular CSS with custom properties (CSS variables)
- **Framework**: Bootstrap 5.3.0 loaded via CDN
- **Custom Styling**: Layered approach with main.css for base styles and style.css for enhancements
- **Design System**: Consistent color scheme, typography, and spacing using CSS custom properties

### JavaScript Architecture
- **Pattern**: Vanilla JavaScript with module-like organization
- **Event Handling**: Modern event listeners with throttling for performance
- **Animation**: AOS (Animate on Scroll) library for scroll-triggered animations
- **Component Initialization**: Centralized initialization system in main.js

### User Interaction Flow
1. **Page Load** → initialize all components and event listeners
2. **Scroll Events** → trigger navigation updates and animations
